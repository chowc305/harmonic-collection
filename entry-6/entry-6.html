      ChaHalo

      I had agreed to pick up Kaylen from her class, but I had an hour to kill before that time. So, I listened to my professor and went to 
      the CD Lectures Series. This lecture was presented by Chia Amisola, a Filipina  internet / ambient artist from Manila, Philippines that 
      blew my mind. Her presentation was something so different from the rest of the presenters. The storytelling, the multitude of interactive websites, her passion and exploration of 
      infinity and narratives was beautiful. Thus, I want to dedicate this page for that eye opening experience.
