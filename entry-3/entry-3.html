Today, Audrey and I went to Xing Fu Tang to grab boba and catch up. We met on move in day freshman year and have been friends ever since. 
    Even with busy schedules, she reached out to me
    and asked to hang out. The price for me came to a total of around nine bucks.</p>

<p>I got the Boba Milk Tea, their signature, with less ice and less sugar. I've had fond memories of this drink- the first 
time I had it was in Hong Kong, 2017. It still had the same taste as I remembered with soft, warm tapioca coated with brown sugar. Since then, brown sugar boba then became my go-to order for any boba place. 
Now I find it too sweet, but nostalgic. I do wish the tea had a stronger taste.</p>

  Audrey got the Ube Coconut Sago, a new edition to the menu. I tried a sip and it was suuuuper sweet and artificial tasting. There was notes of creamy coconut, but barely any hint of ube. Sago balls were just normal.

  Overall, it was good catching up with Audrey after a while.<br> Cherish your friendships and good boba.
