<div class="story">

 <p> It was a surprisingly <span class="blank" data-type="adjective">________</span> afternoon when my roommate and I decided we absolutely needed Hey Tea. I grabbed my <span class="blank" data-type="object">________</span>, she grabbed her <span class="blank" data-type="object">________</span>, and we headed out the door feeling <span class="blank" data-type="emotion">________</span>.

On the way there, we passed a <span class="blank" data-type="place">________</span> where someone was loudly <span class="blank" data-type="verb">________</span>, which made us both laugh. When we finally reached Hey Tea, the line was <span class="blank" data-type="adjective">________</span> but we were determined to wait it out.

While we waited for our drinks, we ended up talking about <span class="blank" data-type="topic">________)</span>, which somehow turned into an argument about <span class="blank" data-type="debate">________</span>.

Before leaving, we took a photo outside the shop, looking absolutely <span class="blank" data-type="adjective">________</span>. Then we walked home, sipping our drinks and already planning our next adventure.
